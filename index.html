          <h3>What Is Redistricting?</h3>
          <p>
            Redistricting is the process of creating geographic areas — known
            as districts — that are represented by one or more distinct persons
            in a legislative body. In many states in the U.S. the legislature
            itself is responsible for creating these districts. This is the case
            in North Carolina, where many of the legislative maps have been declared
            illegal by courts over the past 20 years.
          </p>
          <h3>What Impact Does Redistricting Have?</h3>
          <p>
            Redistricting has a huge impact on how much an individual’s vote matters. If
            you’re a Republican, and Democrats control the state legislature, your vote —
            and the vote of your fellow Republicans — won’t get you as many seats in the
            legislature as a Democrat’s vote and vice versa. If your party controls
            redistricting, your vote matters more, which means your party can probably
            continue to control redistricting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Democrats controlled redistricting for all maps from 2002 to 2010.
            In 2010, Republicans won majorities in both bodies of North Carolina's
            bicameral legislature, giving them control over redistricting. They
            gerrymandered North Carolina — meaning they drew unfair lines so that
            it was easier for them to win elections and harder for Democrats to win.
